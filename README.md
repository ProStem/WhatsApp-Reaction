# WhatsApp-Reaction

Well, WhatsApp made a new Beta update.
You can now react to messages ! cool, right ?
well yeah, but the beta is full,
so to be able to do it - i looked for the functions from a beta allowed user,
and i pasted them in my Browser console, and BOOM i can react to messages.

Note:
This only works in WhatsApp Web via broswer.
